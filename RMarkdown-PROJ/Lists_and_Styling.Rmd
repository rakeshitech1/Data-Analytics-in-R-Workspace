## Data

The `atmos` data set resides in the `nasaweather` package of the *R* programming language. It contains a collection of atmospheric variables measured between 1995 and 2000 on a grid of 576 coordinates in the western hemisphere. The data set comes from the [2006 ASA Data Expo](http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2006/).

Some of the variables in the `atmos` data set are:

* **temp** - The mean monthly air temperature near the surface of the Earth (measured in kelvins (*K*))
* **pressure** - The mean monthly air pressure at the surface of the Earth (measured in millibars (*mb*))
* **ozone** - The mean monthly abundance of atmospheric ozone (measured in Dobson units (*DU*))
