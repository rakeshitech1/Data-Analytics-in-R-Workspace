## Cleaning

For the remainder of the report, we will look only at data from the year 1995. We aggregate our data by location, using the *R* code below.

```{r message = FALSE}
library(nasaweather)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
year <- 1995

means <- atmos %>%
  filter(year == year) %>%
  group_by(long, lat) %>%
  summarize(temp = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE),
         pressure = mean(pressure, na.rm = TRUE),
         ozone = mean(ozone, na.rm = TRUE),
         cloudlow = mean(cloudlow, na.rm = TRUE),
         cloudmid = mean(cloudmid, na.rm = TRUE),
         cloudhigh = mean(cloudhigh, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()
```
